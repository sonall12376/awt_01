## 🏁 Conclusion
This lab helped me gain hands-on experience in *front-end and back-end web development*.  
I learned how to:
- Design interactive front-end applications (HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, Angular).
- Build and deploy backend applications using *Node.js and Express*.
- Handle user sessions, cookies, and server routing.

*Overall Challenge:*  
Initially, understanding how client and server communicate was difficult, but through these experiments, I developed a clear understanding of *full-stack web development*.
